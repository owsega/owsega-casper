A dual personality some may say

But in reality it may not be that way

He thinks with his head - a hacker

He thinks with his heart - a poet

<br/>

On one hand, he's for the arts

On the other, he's for Science

But who'll say there's no science in poems?

Or that hacking is no Art?

<br/>

He writes and he types

Word processing and IDE

His PC is his love

A geek to the core

<br/>

Rhythms and Rhymes

Keywords and commands

It's all about the meter

It's all about the script

<br/>

Either for a poem or a program

All he needs is to be creative

'Think with your head - bring us a code'

'Think with the heart - bring us a psalm'

<br/>

And so I like to see him

Looking out the window, milling the rhymes

Or looking into Windows, killing the bugs

<br/>

Kudos to the poetic programmer

Or shall I say the geeky poet?

It's all about hacking

It's all about rhyming.
