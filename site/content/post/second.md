Harmattan is here again

As it comes every year

It brings no new pain

It is already familiar

<br/>

It is the Nigerian winter

But there is no snow

The skies are clear

Humidity is low

<br/>

It’s all dry and dusty.

Yesterday was a little bit hot, I think.

But today, it can be cold and sunny,

“So thanks, but I don’t need a cold drink”

<br/>

Sanponna ruled the land, in the days of yore

We were told its tenure was majorly harmattan season

We’re thankful those days are no more,

Though people still die, smallpox is no more the reason.

<br/>

Yet, cold and catarrh are still around,

And dry lips and pale skin are not uncommon,

But healing and medicines are also around.

Plus cosmetics, they all offer a solution.

<br/>

But there is more to the season than dread

The holidays are here, it’s the yuletide season

Noel songs on the radio, while we break bread

Our hearts are cheerful for more than one reason

<br/>

I have survived the season for more than one decade

This harmattan is not the worst; I hope it’ll be the best

I thank YHWH for the days he has made

As I sing to myself, the second stanza of Great Is Thy Faithfulness:

<br/>

“Summer and winter, springtime and harvest

Sun, moon and stars in their courses above

Join with all nature in manifold witness

To Thy great faithfulness, mercy and love.”

<br/>

This is my conclusion:

It is written:

“While the earth remaineth,

Seedtime and harvest…

<br/>

And cold and heat, and summer and winter,

And day and night shall not cease”

I know next year, whether I am here or not,

There will be another harmattan.

<br/>

Laus Deo.
